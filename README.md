## Prerequisites

We assume that everyone who comes here is **`programmer with intermediate knowledge`** and we also need to understand more before we begin in order to reduce the knowledge gap.

1. Understand [NestJs Fundamental][ref-nestjs], Main Framework. NodeJs Framework with support fully TypeScript.
2. Understand[Typescript Fundamental][ref-typescript], Programming Language. It will help us to write and read the code.
3. Understand [ExpressJs Fundamental][ref-nodejs], NodeJs Base Framework. It will help us in understanding how the NestJs Framework works.
4. Understand what NoSql is and how it works as a database, especially [MongoDB.][ref-mongodb]
5. Understand Repository Design Pattern or Data Access Object Design Pattern. It will help to read, and write the source code
6. Understand The SOLID Principle and KISS Principle for better write the code.
7. Optional. Understand Microservice Architecture, Clean Architecture, and/or Hexagonal Architecture. It can help to serve the project.
8. Optional. Understanding [The Twelve Factor Apps][ref-12factor]. It can help to serve the project.
9. Optional. Understanding [Docker][ref-docker]. It can help to run the project.

## Getting Started

Before start, we need to install some packages and tools.
The recommended version is the LTS version for every tool and package.

> Make sure to check that the tools have been installed successfully.

1. [NodeJs][ref-nodejs]
2. [MongoDB][ref-mongodb]
3. [Yarn][ref-yarn]
4. [Git][ref-git]

### Clone Repo

Clone the project with git.

```bash
git clone ''
```

### Install Dependencies

This project needs some dependencies. Let's go install it.

```bash
yarn install
```

### Create environment

Make your own environment file with a copy of `env.example` and adjust values to suit your own environment.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

To know the details, you can read the documentation. [Jump to document section](#documentation)

### Database Migration

> The migration will do data seeding to MongoDB. Make sure to check the value of the `DATABASE_` prefix in your`.env` file.

The Database migration used [NestJs-Command][ref-nestjscommand]

For seeding

```bash
yarn seed
```

For remove all data do

```bash
yarn rollback
```

### Test

> The test is still not good net. I'm still lazy too do that.

The project provide 3 automation testing `unit testing`, `integration testing`, and `e2e testing`.

```bash
yarn test
```

For specific test do this

* Unit testing

    ```bash
    yarn test:unit
    ```

* Integration testing

    ```bash
    yarn test:integration
    ```

* E2E testing

    ```bash
    yarn test:e2e
    ```

### Run Project

Finally, Cheers 🍻🍻 !!! you passed all steps.

Now you can run the project.

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

### Run Project with Docker

For docker installation, we need more tools to be installed in our instance.

1. [Docker][ref-docker]
2. [Docker-Compose][ref-dockercompose]

Then run

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### TripMinder Client

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
